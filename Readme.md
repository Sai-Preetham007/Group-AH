Medical Knowledge RAG Chatbot (Healthcare Domain)


Problem Statement :
------------------
In the healthcare industry, accurate and trustworthy information retrieval is critical. Patients and healthcare practitioners often face difficulties finding reliable medical information across sources such as drug databases, clinical trial summaries, and treatment guidelines. Existing chatbots tend to hallucinate or provide unsafe, non-cited responses.

Goal:
-----
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered Medical Knowledge Chatbot that can accurately answer medical and pharmaceutical queries by retrieving facts from verified public datasets (e.g., openFDA, WHO guidelines, or clinical trial summaries) and providing source-cited, safe, and human-readable responses.
